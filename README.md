# Into_Python

The Jupyter Notebook, _"Basics of Python"_ is a brief comprihension of all the important topics of python along with syntaxes and examples. 
It is ideal for anyone who already is familiar with other programming languages and wants to make a switch to python. A detailed study of this notebook will enable you to write almost any program in python (excluding libraries).

Hope this helps ^_^
